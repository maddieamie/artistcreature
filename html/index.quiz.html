<h3> Artist Creature: Dog</h3>
<p>A favorite of humankind since we began writing it all down, dogs are the type of artist that taps into what makes really human. You work with joyful energy, and your art is filled with the pleasures in life. Though you may get easily distracted by companionship or other things (butterflies, maybe), you work hard when it’s time to buckle down. You have a weakness for large markers and big brushstrokes. Embrace how well you work with others and let it influence your practice. We never accomplish anything alone, and you’re the one people want around. Keep it up!</p>
</div>

<div id="catD">
<h3>
Artist Creature: Cat
</h3>
<p>
In the time of ancient Egypt, cats were worshipped by many and did what they pleased the rest of the time. Curious, cautious, and adorable, you approach each art piece from a new angle than where you came from before. Though some may see you as a little haughty, you have a deep affection for those close to you and bring beauty to those in your circle. Mysterious and coy, your wit is the life of the party. You have a weakness for bold, black linework. Embrace the inner workings of your soul and let them onto your canvas. The world will be more accepting than you think. Onward!
</p>
 </div>

  <div id="wolfD">
<h3>
Artist Creature: Wolf
</h3>
<p>
The relationships of the wolf and their packs have saturated human society with analogies and lurid fan-fictions. Though you are seen as being on your own plane, above it all, you are your best self when surrounded by friends and family. Stunning, powerful, and resilient, you blaze through obstacles with a dogged dedication. You art is often created in great bursts of passion. You have a weakness for careful brushstrokes and precision techniques. Let it go every once in a while and be surprised by how far you’ve come on your creative journey. Though you may not know it, others look up to your process, so share the love!

<h3>
Artist Creature: Pink Axolotl
</h3>
<p>
  A rare little bean, the pink axolotl is a unique creature with a demeanor that people find either enchanting or bizarre. As artists, they push the envelope forward in their chosen little pond. They do things that no one has thought of before or spin ideas that make others look at things from a different perspective. They are tied deeply to their roots, whether it be family, heritage, or a place. They enjoy the leisurely life, but only when they have worked hard to earn it. They know what it means to make it in this world: it takes grit. You've got the grit. Don't let anyone let you feel like you don't belong. Make your own splash.
