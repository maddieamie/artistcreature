A javascript personality quiz, an affirmation page, and an about me page! 

# Hello website!
This website is a project for entry into the CodeFellows program. It contains vanilla javascript without a library and beginner html & css.

# What's in this project?
The Artist Creature Quiz is a combination of html forms and javascript interactivity. I wanted to use radio buttons to see how they store information with HTML rules rather than coding every possibility from scratch in Javascript. The questions are all radio buttons that store the user's choice. The submit button does not take the user anywhere, but instead calculates the results of the user's quiz and then presents them with a result at the bottom of the page. The reset button clears the stored answers in the javascript so that if they take the quiz again, the scores will be reset as well. The cat animation is just supposed to be simple and cute, whereas the button animations are just to make it look pressed in a modern way.

The Positive Thoughts page is just an experimentation with having multiple event listeners on the same buttons, and changing specific parts of a div. As of now, the affirmations, fonts, and colors all render as a div and not as an image. In the future, I'd like to experiment with making code that captures the rendered div at a given moment. I experimented with using the html to canvas function, but it needs more research to implement. In the future, I'd like to learn more back-end things for web applications.
